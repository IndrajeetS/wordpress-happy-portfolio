## 🏗️ Internal Structure & Architecture

The theme utilizes a standardized WordPress folder structure with key extensions for modularity and logic separation.

### 📁 Core Logic (`/inc`)
This folder houses all PHP files responsible for theme registration, custom functionality, and hooks. This keeps the root `functions.php` file clean.

* `inc/theme-setup.php`: Enqueuing assets, registering navigation menus, basic theme support.
* `inc/custom-post-types/`: Definition and registration of all custom content types (e.g., `cpt-working-experience.php`).
* `inc/meta-boxes/`: Registration and handling of custom fields for the Admin Dashboard (e.g., `meta-about.php`).

### 📁 Views & Components (`/template-parts`)
All reusable HTML partials and components are stored here. This follows the official WordPress component standard.

* `template-parts/components/`: Small, reusable elements (e.g., `app-navigation.php`).
* `template-parts/pages/`: Content blocks specific to full-page layouts (e.g., `content-home.php`).

### 📁 Assets & Build (`/assets`)
This contains all static files, including source and compiled CSS/JS.

* `assets/css/input.css`: The main source file where Tailwind directives are included.
* `assets/css/output.css`: The compiled and purged CSS file used in production.
* `assets/js/`: Individual JavaScript modules (e.g., `main.js`, `helper.js`).

## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

To start developing and compiling assets, you need Node.js and NPM installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/IndrajeetS/wordpress-happy-portfolio](https://github.com/IndrajeetS/wordpress-happy-portfolio)
    cd happy-portfolio-theme
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(This installs PostCSS, Tailwind, and the `bestzip` utility.)*

3.  **Start the Watcher:**
    Run this command during development. It watches your files and automatically recompiles the CSS whenever you make changes.
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```

## 📦 Building for Production

To create a clean, compressed, production-ready version of the theme, use the `bundle` script.

1.  **Create the Zip File:**
    ```bash
    npm run bundle
    ```

2.  **Output:** This script performs the final Tailwind purge (removing all unused CSS) and creates a clean zip file named `wedo-theme.zip` in the root directory, excluding `node_modules`, config files, and other development dependencies.

3.  **Deployment:** Upload the resulting `wedo-theme.zip` via the WordPress admin panel (**Appearance** > **Themes** > **Add New**).
